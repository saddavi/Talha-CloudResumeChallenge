* `frontend/counter.js`: This is correct now.

**2. Incorrect Code Files:**

* **`frontend/js/counter.js`:** This file is **incorrect**. It's trying to fetch from `/api/VisitorCounterUnique` and has incorrect logic for dealing with the response. **This file must be deleted**.
* **`backend/api/Counter/__init__.py`:** This is **incorrect** and redundant. This file should be **deleted**.
*  **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:** This file is **incorrect** and redundant. This file should be **deleted**.

**3. Correct Workflow Files:**

*   **`.github/workflows/deploy-azure-func.yml`:** This workflow is now mostly **correct**. It's deploying the function app code.
* **`.github/workflows/test-backend.yml`**: This workflow is correct.
* **`.github/workflows/purge-cdn-cache.yml`**: This workflow is correct.

**4. Partially Incorrect Workflow Files:**

* **`.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml`:** This workflow is *mostly* correct, but:
 *   It's checking the wrong API endpoint (`"${{ secrets.API_ENDPOINT_URL }}"`) instead of directly checking `https://talha-resume-func-2025.azurewebsites.net/api/VisitorCounter`.
 * This can be changed to just use the direct url.
* **`.github/workflows/frontend-validation.yml`:** This workflow is mostly correct, but:
* it has `|| true` at the end of the pipeline, this means it will always pass. This is incorrect.
* **Missing `requirements.txt` in `backend/api`:** This file needs to exist.

**5. Redundant/Incorrect `counter.js` and Error**
* You have two `counter.js` files.
* `/frontend/counter.js` is correct
* `/frontend/js/counter.js` is incorrect
* The error message you provided is coming from `/frontend/js/counter.js`, and you should be using `/frontend/counter.js`
* `counter.js:24 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')` this error is because it can not find `visitor-count` element.

**Why You're Seeing the 404 Errors and Other Issues**

1.  **Incorrect `counter.js` is Running:** The main reason for the 404 error is that your *incorrect* `frontend/js/counter.js` file is still present, and it's *likely the one being loaded by the browser*. It's trying to hit `/api/VisitorCounterUnique`, which doesn't exist, hence the 404. `/frontend/counter.js` is now correct.
2.  **Browser/CDN Cache:** The old, incorrect `counter.js` might have been cached by the browser or CDN, so even if you've made changes, they might not be showing up.
3. **Incorrect `deploy-frontend.yml`**
* It will not fail the pipeline, even if the api is incorrect.
4. **Incorrect `frontend-validation.yml`**
* It will not fail the pipeline even if there is an error.
5. **Redundant Files**
* The incorrect files are still present.

**Immediate Action Plan (Critical)**

We need to clean up the incorrect files and ensure the correct `counter.js` is being loaded. Here's the *exact* sequence of commands and steps you must take:

1.  **Delete Incorrect Files:**

 ```bash
 git rm frontend/js/counter.js
 git rm backend/api/Counter/__init__.py
 git rm .github/workflows/deploy.yml
 ```

2. **Add `requirements.txt`:**
* Make sure you have created the `requirements.txt` file in `backend/api` with the following contents:
  ```text
  pymongo
  azure-functions
  ```
* Add it to the git:
  ```bash
    git add backend/api/requirements.txt
  ```
3. **Correct `deploy-frontend.yml`**
*  Open the file, and edit the following line:
   ```yaml
   API_ENDPOINT="${{ secrets.API_ENDPOINT_URL }}"
   ```
* change it to this:
```yaml
API_ENDPOINT="https://talha-resume-func-2025.azurewebsites.net/api/VisitorCounter"
